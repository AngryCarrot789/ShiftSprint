# ShiftSprint
A mod that lets you sprint using the shift key in older versions of minecraft

yes it's using searge mappings, because i have no clue how to properly setup MCP/FML/Forge :'(

actually i do but it didnt work even after manually editing the python script and replacing HTTP with HTTPS and manually removing sys.exit and stuff :( dunno why they didn't just use java. It's a bodge :)

Ignore the render and transformer folder... i was trying to understand how the tesselator worked, and the transformer was used to extract the entirety of minecraft's source by writing the fully transformed classes to a file
