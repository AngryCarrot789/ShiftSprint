# ShiftSprint
A mod that lets you sprint using the shift key in older versions of minecraft

yes its using searge mappings, because i have no clue how to properly setup MCP/FML/Forge :'(

actually i do but it didnt work even after manually editing the python script and replacing HTTP with HTTPS and manually removing sys.exit and stuff :( dunno why they didnt just use java

its a bodge :)
